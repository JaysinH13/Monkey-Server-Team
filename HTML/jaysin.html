      Hi my name is Jaysin H, and this is my about page.<br>
      Im not a huge fan of OneDrive as it can be pretty stupid at at times. <br>
      Im not to social around people I dont know but around friends I can be talkative.<br>
      I dont really have any career goals for myself at the moment, but if I had to chose I would say something along the lines with game design.<br>
      The concept for this game is pretty weird, as it's more on little nods about me. A lot of easter egg ideas. <br>
